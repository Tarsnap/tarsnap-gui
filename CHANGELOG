Version 1.1.0 (unreleased)
--------------------------

Change of behaviour:
* On MacOS X, the config file has a new filename and is always saved in INI
  format (allowing easy access via a text editor).  The old config file will be
  renamed to "OLDNAME.DATE.bak" (the exact filename will be displayed in the
  start-up message when first running this version of Tarsnap-GUI).
* The header of the Archives and Jobs tabs is now always present; the option
  to disable them was removed.
* An archive or job name cannot begin or end with whitespace.

New features:
* Checks for a network connection before attempting to back up an archive.
* The desktop notifications are clickable and navigate to an appropriate part
  of the application (i.e. clicking on a "Backup is completed" message shows
  its details in the Archives tab).

Fixes:
* Many small "corner case" fixes due to our new test suite.


Version 1.0.2
-------------

This adds two new features for MacOS X:

* Adds a --check option to update the MacOS X launchd path (in case the app's
  path changed, for example during a brew update).
* Automatically searches for the tarsnap CLI in /usr/local/bin (which is where
  brew puts it, but this directory is not added to the $PATH for GUI apps).

It also includes two bugfixes:

* The MacOS X app->"get info" now displays the version number.
* An existing job's options can now be saved to disk.


Version 1.0.1
-------------

This fixes build problems with Qt 5.10 and 5.11.


Version 1.0
-----------

New features:
* Automatic Job backup scheduling can now be enabled in Settings -> Backup.
Launchd service on MacOS and CRON on Linux/BSD will be used. Individual Job
scheduling intervals Daily, Weekly and Monthly can be enabled individually for
each Job. For more on this see:
https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap-gui/wiki/Scheduling
* The app has full I18N support and sports full translation to other languages.
By default the app will use the language set on your system, though currently
there is only one extra translation, Romanian, my native language :-). You can
override the language setting in Settings -> Application. We need your help
for extra languages, if you'd like to offer a translation to your native
language get in touch with us and we'll provide the necessary support needed
for you to do that.
* Add Archives/Jobs pane headers. Displays items count and search tool icon.
Can be hidden via the menu bar Window entry.
* Added the ability to search/filter in the Archive and Job lists. Press
CTRL+F keyboard shortcut in the Archives and Jobs panes respectively and the
filter box will appear. You can use shell globbing patterns to filter or
simple text to search.
* When adding a new Job, check to see if there are any archives that match the
new Job name prefix and that aren't assigned to any existing Job, if so offer
to assign to the new Job; This helps with restoring lost Jobs, either via an
app or system reset.
* Truncated and empty archives are now distinguished as such. Also significant
improvements to archive contents parsing and listing.
* Archive contents now displays the long listing format with sortable columns.
* You can now search/filter through the Archive contents, just like the
Archive&Jobs lists. Top that with the ability to restore individual/select
files from your archives.
* FilePicker display settings like ShowHidden, ShowSystem are now remembered
on a per Job basis. This fixes the issue where selected files and dirs that
are not visible by default in the FilePicker were not being displayed in the
Jobs details widget.
* You can run concurrent restore operations now.
* Console log can now be saved to a file. Option available in Settings -> App.

Improvements and fixes:
* Homebrew recipe now uses mac-deploy-qt to install Tarsnap.app on your system.
* Copy relevant global settings to new Jobs by default.
* Remember last desktop position and window geometry and restore on launch.
* Many memory and performance improvements. The app should be much faster,
lighter on resources and more robust than ever.
* Many improvements and fixes to FilePicker dialog, which makes it more
reliable and robust than before.
* Archives sync with remote is now smarter and less redundant.
* Greatly improved restore behavior, safety and UI.
* The Setup Wizard has been redesigned and further improved. There's only 4
pages now of which only 2 are for configuration.
* Various improvements to the Archives list, including but not limited to:
  * Grey out Job prefix and timestamp suffix;
  * Removed useless icon on the left of each item;
  * Archives are now properly enabled/disabled after failed/canceled delete
  tasks;

* Significant improvements to error handling and reporting:
  * Warn when a keyfile is missing or a cachedir is not found.
  * Forward critical CLI errors such as network not available.
  * Warn when quitting the App with running/scheduled tasks; offer to clear,
  interrupt or proceed in background.
  * Detect Jobs with invalid backup paths. Autodetect when paths pertaining
  to a Job have been mounted/dismounted/deleted and warn when needed.

* Significant Improvements to Jobs. Working with Jobs should be more robust
and intuitive than before.
* Various usability and accessibility improvements, including but not limited
to:
  * Improved helpful tooltips coverage and wording;
  * Actions and button tooltips now include the afferent platform specific
  keyboard shortcut for triggering the said action;
  * Added menu bar actions for platforms that harness a unified menu bar like
 OS X and Ubuntu Unity;

* Purge archives operation has been renamed to Nuke to be in line with the CLI
action.
* Settings pane has been overhauled and options have been regrouped into the
following categories, Account, Backup & Application.
* Console log output is truncated now for list archives and archive contents
operations which can produce enormous amounts of text. This significantly
reduces memory usage and improves performance for those cases.
* Ignore default tarsnap config files by default (--no-default-config).
* Code wise, there's Doxygen comments now, many improvements, cleanups and
refactorings resulting in a much improved code base. 
* Overall, the app is leaner, better looking and faster due to various
refactorings and improvements.
* Many bugs, UI issues and other inconsistencies have now been resolved.
The app is now more robust than ever.

Version 0.9
-----------

New features:

* Added ability to download an archive as a tar file. This option is available
in the restore dialog window.
* You can now review your account and machine activity logs via the Settings ->
Account page. Tarsnap login is required just like with credit. I recommend you
upgrade Tarsnap CLI to 1.0.37 for optimal results.
* Added ability to gracefully interrupt running backups from stop tasks dialog,
by sending SIGQUIT to Tarsnap CLI. The current archive creation will be
truncated and '.part' is appended to the archive name.
* On vanilla configuration the app now offers to add default Jobs for common
home directories like Desktop, Pictures and Documents.
* You can now quickly create a Job from the current Backup list using the
Backup button drop-down.
* Added bandwidth limiting settings for upload and download rates in
Settings -> Application.
* Added Home button to the File Browser that when clicked quickly jumps the
browse tree to the user's home directory.
* Homebrew is now the preferred installation method for OS X. Port and pkg's are
available for FreeBSD too. See INSTALL dist file.

Improvements and fixes:
* Made SI notation default in the UI with option to switch to IEC.
* Added more useful keyboard shortcuts for the actions available in the Archives
and Jobs lists.
* Beautified the restore dialog widget. Improvements for the Restore
functionality.
* Archives that are queued for deletion are now disabled in the Archive lists
until the operation has concluded.
* Significant improvements to the Setup Wizard. The dialog should now be even
easier to follow, with one step removed.
* Made Console Log easier to read.
* Improvements to CLI version detection.
* Support for highres/density displays is now 99% complete.
* Overall, the app is leaner, better looking and faster due to various
refactorings and improvements.
* Many bugs, leaks, UI issues and other inconsistencies have now been resolved.
The app is now more robust than ever.

I've also written a tutorial on getting started with Tarsnap GUI for OS X
available at http://shinnok.com/rants/2016/02/19/using-tarsnap-gui-on-os-x/.

Version 0.8
-----------

New features:
* Add Homebrew recipe for easy installation on OS X.
* The app can now be opened from headless operation, by clicking on
notification icon or messages.
* Upgrade the task cancel functionality. Now, one can either clear the queued
tasks, stop the running ones or both.
* Implement Simulation mode with the help of --dry-run. No new archives will be
uploaded to the Tarsnap servers while this mode is on. The option is available
in Settings -> Advanced. Disabling simulation mode or refreshing the Archives
list will roll back all new archives and stats. Simulation mode is conveniently
flagged while active with a bolt icon close to the busy indicator in the status
bar.
* Implement nodump global and per job setting. When enabled, files flagged as
nodump in the file system will be skipped when backing up.
* Implement ignore default tarsnap configs option (tarsnap.conf and tarsnaprc),
using tarsnap --no-default-config parameter.
* The app now features a persistent Journal log. All your tarsnap actions in
either normal or headless operation are stored and available for later review.
The Journal can be cleared in Settings -> Advanced.

Improvements and fixes:
* Use monospaced fixed width fonts for increased readability of Journal and
Console logs as well other places where it made sense and text align nicely.
* Upgraded the Qt signal slot connect syntax. For end users, performance is the
main gain from this.
* Cache archive contents as compressed (zlib) blobs and only decompress when
needed for display. This significantly reduces overall memory usage, Sqlite DB
size on disk and in memory and greatly increases the app's performance overall.
* Improved error handling for several cases, among them cache errors are now
gracefully handled.
* Overall, the app is leaner, better looking and faster due to various
refactorings and C++11/14 adoption.
* Many bugs, UI issues and other inconsistencies have now been resolved.

Version 0.7
-----------

New features:
* Skip files from backup using shell globbing patterns. This option is
available as a global setting (for excluding system junk files for example) and
as a Job specific option.
* Add system notifications. They are shown in both normal and headless mode.
They can be disabled in Settings.
* Add option in wizard advanced page to ensure settings are stored in INI
format.
* Add --appdata command line option. Useful for multiple configurations on the
same machine (INI format is implied).
* Ability to grab the Tarsnap credit from the website. User and password is
required and are transmitted over https. Password is used only once and is not
stored.
* Detect Tarsnap client version and use it to discriminate features
availability.
* Look for existing keys and prompt them to the user when in setup wizard.

Improvements and fixes:
* Added DB upgrade mechanism. Version updates will go smooth from now on.
* Redesigned the Job details widget to be more efficient and intuitive.
* 99% of the UI looks gorgeous in high res/dpi displays now.
* Archive removal from the UI upon delete is now lazy fashioned.
* Archive sync between the local store and the remote has been greatly
improved. You should experience less discrepancies than before.
* Archives get automagically re/assigned to Jobs based on job prefixes upon
sync from remote.
* Fixed various UI update issues between Archives and Jobs tabs when archives
are being manipulated.
* Improved error journal and log messages.
* Many performance and stability concerns have been fixed or improved. A slew
of UI annoyances and bugs have also been fixed.

Caveats:
* Some internally used settings keys have been renamed for consistency and upon
upgrading from an older version the setup wizard dialog will pop up. Follow the
prompts and select "Yes" when asked if you have used Tarsnap on this machine in
the past and have a key. Select the previous key if available in the dropdown
list or locate it manually and proceed. You jobs and settings should remain
unchanged.

Version 0.6
-----------

Improvements and fixes:
* Add About widget and menubar entry in conformity with Apple's HID guidelines.
* Add command line arguments -h and -v; needed for OS X Homebrew consideration.
* Automatic job backups via the --jobs command argument. Can be used with cron
scheduling or otherwise. There's a job specific option 'Include in scheduled
backups' that controls which jobs will get executed.
* Added ability to cancel any running operation by clicking on the busy icon.
* Tristate checkboxes in the FilePicker file system tree view. Partially
checked directories signify a partial selection of child items.
* Visually indicate archives pertaining to a job in the Archives pane.
* Upgraded the Add job button looks and functionality. Has a dropdown menu with
'Backup all jobs' action.
* Display cached archives on startup until the remote sync has completed.
* Ctrl+j toggles the Journal log widget now.
* Purge operation now requires typing the 'No Tomorrow'; similar to CLI.
* Add some extra confirmations as safety checks when deleting archives in bulk.
* Implement proper access locking to the Sqlite DB. Should fix any concurrent
access issues.
* Various other improvements and fixes, including some based on the feedback
following the v0.5 release.

Caveats:
* The Sqlite DB schema has changed. It's best to reset the app settings before
upgrading to the new version using the Settings -> Run Setup Wizard
functionality. You need to recreate your Jobs following the upgrade. Next
release will include a DB update method.
