Easy installation
=================

Package installation is available for some OS'es while others are pending.

----
OS X
----

Tarsnap GUI can be easily installed on OS X via the Homebrew package manager:

1) Install Homebrew from https://brew.sh
2) To install tarsnap-gui (including all dependencies) run this in Terminal:
$brew install tarsnap-gui

The Tarsnap.app bundle is created in:
  /usr/local/Cellar/tarsnap-gui/VERSION/

Homebrew installs the tarsnap cli programs in /usr/local/bin, so use that in
the Setup Wizard Advanced page.

-------
FreeBSD
-------

Tarsnap GUI is part of the pkg/ports collection of FreeBSD. To install using
pkg is as simple as:
$ pkg install tarsnap tarsnap-gui 

===================
Source installation
===================

If there aren't any packages for your OS or you plan on doing development,
want the latest version or just like building from source, this section is for
you.

Tarsnap GUI is built using the Qt SDK for cross-platform support. In order
to build Tarsnap GUI for your system, you must first install the appropriate
Qt 5 SDK on your system. Minimum recommended version for optimal results and
platform support is Qt 5.4.0 or greater, though it is known to behave just fine
on at least Qt 5.2.1. Use the Qt Online Installer if your platform doesn't
provide better means (repositories, homebrew) for installing the SDK:
https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/

Next step for all platforms is to install the Tarsnap command-line client on
your system using the steps at:
https://www.tarsnap.com/download.html

Once you have the Qt SDK setup and Tarsnap client installed you can proceed to
building this Tarsnap GUI.

-------------------
Qt designer plugins
-------------------

We have a few widgets in lib/widgets/ which are useful to have
directly in the Qt designer.  To enable those, go to
    lib/plugins/
to compile and install them.  It should work with:
    qmake && make install
as long as there's no problems about Qt 4 vs. 5.  (See below for
such problems.)


--------------------
OS X Yosemite and up
--------------------

Assuming that you have already built and installed the Tarsnap command-line
client and Qt SDK, you have already configured your system for development.
As a minimum requirement for building this app you'll need to install the Xcode
command-line tools.

Unless you're planning on doing serious development for the app, I recommend
installing the dependencies via Homebrew for the simple reason that it gets you
up and running with the minimum amount of effort. After you install homebrew
all you need to do is "brew install tarsnap qt5" to get the requirements in
place.

Assuming you survived up until now, let's proceed to the actual steps for
building the app for your system:

1) git clone https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap-gui.git && cd tarsnap-gui
2) git checkout v1.0 # switch to the desired stable version
3) qmake # /usr/local/opt/qt5/bin/qmake for Homebrew
4) make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
5) open ./Tarsnap.app

Optionally, if you want to install the app on your system:
6) cp -r ./Tarsnap.app /Applications/

-------------------
FreeBSD 10.1 and up
-------------------

Last tested on FreeBSD 10.1 with Qt 5.3.2 and KDE 4/GNOME 3.

1) pkg install git qt5-core qt5-widgets qt5-qmake qt5-network qt5-buildtools qt5-sql qt5-sqldrivers-sqlite3
2) git clone https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap-gui.git && cd tarsnap-gui
3) git checkout v1.0 # switch to the desired version
4) /usr/local/lib/qt5/bin/qmake
5') (This seems to have been fixed with Qmake 3.0/Qt5.5.1/FreeBSD10.3)
Edit the resulted Makefile and append ",-L,/usr/local/lib" to the LFLAGS line. Somehow
the clang++ spec of qmake ommits that on FreeBSD. The complete line should look like this:
LFLAGS        = -pthread -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/lib,-L,/usr/local/lib
6) make -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
7) ./tarsnap-gui

--------------------
Debian based distros
--------------------

These steps apply to all the Debian based flavors and have been
tested on these distros so far:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 15.04 Vivid
* Ubuntu 14.04.2 LTS Trusty
* Linux Mint 17.1 Cinnamon
* Linux Mint 19.3 Tricia
* Debian 8 Jessie

All of them seem to include the Qt5 SDK in the official main repos.

1) sudo apt-get install g++ git make qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools
2) git clone https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap-gui.git && cd tarsnap-gui
3) git checkout v1.0 # switch to the desired version
4) QT_SELECT=qt5 qmake && make -j$(nproc)
5) ./tarsnap-gui

---------------------
Red Hat based distros
---------------------

Tested on Fedora 22

1) sudo yum install gcc-c++ git qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-linguist
2) git clone https://github.com/Tarsnap/tarsnap-gui.git && cd tarsnap-gui
3) git checkout v1.0 # switch to the desired version
4) qmake-qt5 && make -j$(nproc)
5) ./tarsnap-gui
